# SpreakerSearch 

# Required Configuration:

Change the show ID here by replacing *CHANGEME*:
```javascript
const baseUrl = "https://api.spreaker.com/v2/shows/*CHANGEME*/episodes";
```

And customize:
```html
<h1>SEARCH RESULTS FOR *CHANGEME*</h1>
```
There may still be parts in Italian, I donâ€™t feel like modifying it further.
